  "projectName": "Concept Delta",

    {
      "id": "REQ-25",
      "text": "Update ProfileSetupModal.tsx so the modal overlay uses a solid dark background (e.g. rgba(0,0,0,0.85) or bg-gray-900) and the modal card itself uses a solid white background (#FFFFFF) with navy (#0A1F44) text. Remove any semi-transparent or translucent background styles that cause the underlying page content to show through the modal, making the form fields and labels unreadable.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "The modal overlay behind the ProfileSetupModal card is fully opaque dark (no page content visible through it).",
        "The modal card has a solid white (#FFFFFF) background — no transparency or blur effect.",
        "All form labels (Full Name, Class, Contact Number), input fields, validation messages, and the Save & Continue button are clearly readable against the solid white card.",
        "The modal appearance is consistent on both desktop and mobile viewports.",
        "No underlying home page content bleeds through the modal card or its overlay."
