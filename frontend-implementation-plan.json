Apply solid dark background (rgba(0,0,0,0.85) or bg-gray-900/85) to the dialog overlay backdrop. Apply solid white background (#FFFFFF or bg-white) to the dialog card container. Ensure all dialog text uses navy (#0A1F44 or text-navy-900) for readability. Verify 'Submit Now' button has solid navy background with white text, and 'Continue Test' button has appropriate solid styling. Test on both mobile and desktop viewports to ensure no transparency issues."
