{
  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global styles with Navy Blue (#0A1F44) OKLCH color system, Inter/Space Grotesk fonts, hero gradient utilities, and light/dark mode tokens strictly using navy and white palette.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Extended Tailwind config with Inter/Space Grotesk fonts, navy color palette with full shade scale, navy shadow utilities, and fade-in animation.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root app with TanStack Router, all routes wired, and ProfileSetupModal shown only when user is authenticated, not initializing, profile query is complete, and profile is null (first-time user).",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useGetCallerUserProfile.ts": "Standalone hook for fetching the caller's user profile, now gated on both actor readiness and user authentication (identity present) to prevent unauthorized backend calls and profile setup modal flash.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "All React Query hooks for backend operations; `useIsCallerAdmin` is fixed to use `query.isLoading` (isPending && isFetching) instead of `query.isPending` for the `isLoading` override, so it correctly transitions to `false` once the query resolves — preventing the Admin button from being permanently hidden due to a stuck loading state.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useTestTimer.ts": "Custom countdown timer hook accepting duration in minutes, returning formatted MM:SS time, percentage remaining, and isExpired flag with auto-cleanup.",
  "frontend/src/components/Navbar.tsx": "Responsive sticky navbar with Internet Identity login/logout; the Admin link uses `useIsCallerAdmin` and shows only when `isAdmin === true` and `adminLoading` is false — unchanged in structure but now benefits from the fixed `isLoading` logic in the hook.",
  "frontend/src/components/ProfileSetupModal.tsx": "Profile setup modal for first-time login users, now rendered with a fully opaque dark overlay (rgba(0,0,0,0.88)) and a solid white (#ffffff) card with navy (#0A1F44) text — no transparency or backdrop-blur that would allow the underlying page to bleed through. Uses custom inline styles to guarantee solid backgrounds regardless of the app's dark theme CSS variables.",
  "frontend/src/components/TestCard.tsx": "Test card with white background, navy border, navy title text, and solid navy Start Test button with white text and hover state.",
  "frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx": "Route guard that redirects unauthenticated users to the home page, showing a spinner during initialization.",
  "frontend/src/components/AdminRoute.tsx": "Route guard that checks authentication, admin status, and first-visit status; redirects unauthenticated users to `/`, non-admins to `/dashboard`, and admins who have already visited the admin panel back to `/dashboard` with an informational toast.",
  "frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx": "Home page with updated hero section featuring the exact heading \"Free MHT-CET Mock Tests\", COEPians subheading, student-focused body copy with benefits checklist, a \"Start Practicing Now\" CTA, Telegram button linking to https://t.me/Conceptdelta, and YouTube button linking to https://youtube.com/@conceptdelta2026 — all in Navy Blue and White theme.",
  "frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx": "Protected dashboard with navy header banner, white background, navy stat labels, and test cards grid with grey loading skeletons — no off-theme colors.",
  "frontend/src/pages/TestPage.tsx": "Protected test-taking page that pre-loads all question images via `new Image()` as soon as test data arrives (showing a \"Preparing your test...\" screen until the first image is ready), then renders the test UI with instant image display; submission now immediately closes the confirm dialog, shows a full-screen navy submitting overlay, and navigates directly to results after the single backend round-trip completes.",
  "frontend/src/pages/TestResultPage.tsx": "Protected result page showing a marks-based score card (marks / maxMarks with progress bar and percentage), a 3-column answer breakdown (correct/wrong/skipped), and a marking scheme panel showing points per correct answer and negative marking penalty — all in Navy Blue and White theme.",
  "frontend/src/pages/AdminPage.tsx": "Admin-only page with navy header, tab navigation, and five content tabs; calls `markAdminVisited()` once on first mount via a ref-guarded effect to record the admin's first visit.",

  "frontend/src/components/admin/TestBuilder.tsx": "Admin test creation form with a dedicated \"Marking Scheme\" section containing numeric inputs for \"Marks per Correct Answer\" (default 1, min 1) and \"Negative Marks per Wrong Answer\" (default 0, min 0), with inline validation errors and a live max-marks preview badge; passes both values to the `createTest` backend call.",
  "frontend/src/components/admin/TestManagement.tsx": "Admin test list table with navy header row, white/alternating rows, navy publish status badge, and navy-styled Switch toggle.",
  "frontend/src/components/admin/UsersTab.tsx": "Admin users table with navy header row, white/alternating rows, and navy class badge — all strictly navy/white palette.",
  "frontend/src/components/admin/ResultsTab.tsx": "Admin results table updated to display marks-based scores (marks / maxMarks with percentage) in the primary score column, a separate \"Correct\" column showing raw correct/total counts, and a marking scheme hint row when negative marking is active."
