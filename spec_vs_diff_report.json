  "summary": "The diff shows that Navbar.tsx still uses the old `useIsCallerAdmin` hook and the old `showAdmin` logic (checking `isAdmin === true` with `adminLoading`), rather than replacing it with `useGetCallerUserProfile` as required by REQ-37. The `useGetCallerUserProfile` hook exists in `useQueries.ts` but is not used in Navbar.tsx. The core requirement to rewrite the Admin link visibility logic using `useGetCallerUserProfile` with Option unwrapping (array index [0]) has not been implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-37",
      "requirement": "Completely rewrite the Admin link visibility logic in Navbar.tsx. Remove all existing useIsCallerAdmin, useGetCallerRole, or any route-gated admin check hooks. Replace with a single unconditional call to useGetCallerUserProfile that is enabled whenever the user is authenticated (isAuthenticated === true). Unwrap the Option returned by the backend (array index [0]) before reading isAdmin. Derive showAdmin = unwrappedProfile?.isAdmin === true.",
      "reason": "Navbar.tsx still imports and uses `useIsCallerAdmin` and derives `showAdmin` from `isAdmin === true && !adminLoading`. The `useGetCallerUserProfile` hook is not used in Navbar.tsx. The Option unwrapping via array index [0] is not implemented. The old hook has not been removed.",
