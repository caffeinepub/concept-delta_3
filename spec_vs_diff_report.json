  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-23 and REQ-24 largely correctly. REQ-23 is addressed by replacing Google Login with Internet Identity in Navbar.tsx (login/logout via useInternetIdentity hook, no Google references). REQ-24 is addressed via ProfileSetupModal.tsx wired in App.tsx using useGetCallerUserProfile to detect first-time users and show the modal, with redirect to /dashboard on save. The implementation appears complete for both requirements.",

      "description": "A backend migration module (backend/migration.mo) was added that defines OldActor and NewActor types and a run() migration function, even though no backend data model changes were requested.",
      "reason": "The build request explicitly states 'Modifying the backend data model for user profiles (already implemented)' is a non-goal, and no migration was requested. The migration file appears unnecessary and was not part of any requirement.",
