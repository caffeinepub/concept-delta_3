  "summary": "Both REQ-31 and REQ-32 appear to be implemented in the diff. TestPage.tsx is modified to pre-load question images using new Image() and to show an immediate submitting overlay on confirmation. The file summary explicitly describes both behaviors.",

      "description": "A 'Preparing your test...' loading screen is shown until the first image is ready before rendering the test UI",
      "reason": "REQ-31 requires pre-loading to happen in the background without blocking the rendering of the test UI or the countdown timer. Gating the entire test UI on image readiness contradicts the AC 'Pre-loading does not block the rendering of the test UI or the countdown timer.' The file summary states the page shows a 'Preparing your test...' screen until the first image is ready, which is not requested and potentially violates REQ-31.",
