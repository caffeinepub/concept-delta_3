Use the browser's Image constructor to pre-load each question's image URL in the background immediately after the test and question list are fetched. This ensures that when the user navigates to any question — including the first one displayed on test start — the image renders instantly without a visible loading delay.",

When the user confirms submission (or the timer expires), immediately transition the UI to a 'Submitting…' loading state so the user receives instant visual feedback.

After the backend responds, navigate to the result screen without additional round-trips.",
