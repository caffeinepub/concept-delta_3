The dialog currently renders with a transparent or semi-transparent background, causing the underlying question content to show through and making the confirmation text ('Submit Test?', 'You have answered X out of Y questions...'), the 'Submit Now' button, and the 'Continue Test' button unreadable. Remove all transparent or translucent background styles from the confirmation dialog overlay and card.",
