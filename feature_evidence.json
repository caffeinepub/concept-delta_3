After the admin successfully loads the admin page for the first time, call `markAdminVisited()` on the backend. On any subsequent navigation to `/admin`, if `hasAdminBeenVisited()` returns `true`, redirect the user to the dashboard (`/dashboard`) with a toast or inline message explaining that the admin panel is only accessible on first login.",
