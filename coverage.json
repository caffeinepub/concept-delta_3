Use the browser's Image constructor to pre-load each question's image URL in the background immediately after the test and question list are fetched. This ensures that when the user navigates to any question — including the first one displayed on test start — the image renders instantly without a visible loading delay.",

The backend call to submitTestResult must be the only async operation blocking the result screen — eliminate any unnecessary sequential awaits, redundant refetches, or delays before the post-submission screen is shown. After the backend responds, navigate to the result screen without additional round-trips.",
