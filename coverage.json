        "summary": "Completely rewrite the Admin link visibility logic in Navbar.tsx. Remove all existing useIsCallerAdmin, useGetCallerRole, or any route-gated admin check hooks. Replace with a single unconditional call to useGetCallerUserProfile that is enabled whenever the user is authenticated (isAuthenticated === true), with no route condition or path guard whatsoever. Unwrap the Option returned by the backend (Motoko Option maps to a JS array — read index [0] to get the profile object, then read profile.isAdmin). Derive showAdmin = unwrappedProfile?.isAdmin === true. Render the 'Admin' navigation link in both the desktop nav and the mobile hamburger menu as soon as showAdmin is true, on every route including '/'. Never hide or reset the Admin link based on the current route. The Admin link must remain hidden for unauthenticated users and authenticated non-admin users. Maintain the existing Navy Blue (#0A1F44) and White theme styling throughout.",
